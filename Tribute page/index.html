				joined the ‘Young Revolutionary Movement.’ He then began to advocate violent overthrow of the British
				Government in India.<br><br>

				Revolutionary Activities
			</h1>
			<p>
				The British government set up the ‘Simon Commission’ to report on the political situation in India in
				1928. The commission did not include even a single Indian as its member and this greatly agitated the
				Indian leaders, leading to protests across the country by Indian political parties.<br><br>
				The commission visited Lahore on 30 October 1928. Lala Lajpat Rai, a prominent leader of the Indian
				independence movement, led a silent march in protest against the Commission. The British police resorted
				to violence in their attempts to quell the protest.<br><br>
				The superintendent of police James A. Scott ordered a baton charge against the protesters and Rai was
				grievously injured. He died a few days later on 17 November 1928 of a heart attack. His injuries were
				believed to have hastened his untimely death.<br><br>
				However, when the matter of his death was raised in the British Parliament, the British Government
				denied any role in Rai's death. Enraged by this incident, Singh vowed to avenge Rai’s death and teamed
				up with other revolutionaries, such as Shivaram Rajguru, Sukhdev Thapar, and Chandrashekhar Azad to plot
				Scott’s murder.

				The shooting was scheduled to take place on 17 December 1928. Interestingly, a case of mistaken identity
				ensued and the revolutionaries killed John P. Saunders instead of Scott. Saunders, an assistant
				superintendent of police, was shot to death as he was leaving the District Police Headquarters in
				Lahore.The superintendent of police James A. Scott ordered a baton charge against the protesters and Rai

				The young revolutionaries had already planned an elaborate escape and were successful in evading arrest.
				A day after Saunders was killed, a leaflet was circulated by the ‘Hindustan Socialist Republican
				Association,’ announcing that the death of Lala Lajpat Rai had been avenged.
